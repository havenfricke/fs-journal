# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week was hard. MVCS model is hard to grasp with how it all works together within the actual code. In concept not so much.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Grasped MVCS model and how it talks to itself.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
Turning a boolean in to number values with a ternary and using the length of an array that holds these boolean then string interpolating all this to create a "total completed items"  template. I still have no idea how to.
- What would you count as a victory?
Finally understanding mvcs model.
