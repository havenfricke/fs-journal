> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

By using a one-to-many dependancy between objects, it helps to ensure that in the event one object changes a number of dependant object will also automatically update and change. 


2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanisms of the observer pattern are 1) that they allow a way through methods to enable and disable the observer, 2) keeps a list of subscribers and observers, and 3) notifies the subscirbers and observers once a state has changed.


3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

When the observer pattern is assigned by what we have called in class as "listeners", the code is seeking out any changes made (mostly indicated by the = sign) and also keeping track of any events that pass through a "lens' in which the oberserver has been assigned. Even further, we can tell our "listener" with the observer pattern to perform a function every time an event passes through what it is watching.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Todays assignment I took away that our "listener, which we addressed in class, has a technical term named the observer pattern.
