## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Set and get.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

Since the get operation takes in two parameters, the object it is accessing and a proprty of that object.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

They can provide security to the properties of an object. For instance, we can check to see if an objects properties are being access and throw an error if they are, else, we can return the objects properties in any other instance.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A handler in concept is a two pronged fork that gets or sets an object and a property of that object and uses that data as parameters in a functional task.
