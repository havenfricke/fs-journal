## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Objects states are stored privately and only the objects methods can access the data which in turn hides the data values that are being used.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

A matter of private information is involved with these two things. Internal properties change much more often than public properties. Using an underscore at the beginning of a name of something in your code, for instance a function, when naming is essentially a way to indicate that this particular piece of code is not intended for users to call directly. People who are newer at coding use these conventions incorrectly and it is something that can break your code.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

A variable defined in a constructor function scope is private. If data can be manipulated through a console, values which are to remain and are dependent on functions of code can be altered for better or worse on the client side.
