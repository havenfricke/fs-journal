# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

C# is definitely a more clunky and bulky feeling language. I personally like Node.js better. 

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Learned the MVC pattern with C# this week
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
C# is not at all what I expect in terms of how it operates
- What are you struggling with?
MySql commands especially JOIN and ON
- What would you count as a victory?
Being able to write a backend for c#
