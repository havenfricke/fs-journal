## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value - A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.

Reference - a reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.

Pointer - Basicaly what the reference data type uses to point to where the data is stored.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

In the case of Value, there really isn't much difference between javascript and c#. The Value data type is referring specifically to the data assigned to that variable.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types have a "mailman' called a pointer that gets the Value of data from an address. It's similar to when you put postage in your mailbox and lift the little flag up (pointer) indicating that the mailman needs to get someonthing out of the mailbox to deliver because an address was referenced.

C# feels clunky and less lightweight than javascript but I am aware of it's capability which is sort of astonishing.
