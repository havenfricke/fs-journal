## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A List in C# is very similar to an array. It is in essence an object that holds variables in a specific order.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.index to find, List.add for creating and adding, and List.copyto because this at it's basic form seems like a spread operator to me in JavaScript.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

List[index] to specifiy at which index you want an item. List.find, List.finindex, and List.findall would work as well in finding items within an index.
