## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Data in a row reads from left to right and a column reads top to bottom. Data in a row is pertinent to a single object where as a column is pertinent to data properties.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL
) default charset utf8;

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

The first statement deletes content from a table and the second one deletes an entire database table.
```
