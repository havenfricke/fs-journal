## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing, component testing, and end-to-end testing. Unit testing is testing small bits of code that are all interdependant and can offer confidence in your methods of code and functionality. Component testing is acheived when you are injecting into the DOM. Granted most components in vue are accomplishing this through v-for, there really is no way to test that data is being drawn, computed, watched, or mounted without a visual representation that includes the DOM. This is due to the nature of what compnents are used for. End-to-end testing is by for the most encompassing type of testing which involves using your application to see how the actual use of your application effects both the front and back end of the application. It just might be the most effective since the unit testing and component testing are limited to the scope.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Each have their purpose but I would say unit testing is the most useful and effect. Lets assume the architecture and relationships of our data have been well thought out. We may run into issues along the way in getting functions and components to work but if we have a clear and distinct path of how things should work, unit testing is the most effective because it has the potential to involve compnents and whether or not your back end is working properly. While end-to-end testing does take care of this, it seems very hard to do while your application is still under development. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

end-to-end testing seems the least effective even though it is the most ecompassing type. It can really only be accomplished once the application is somewhere near finished and if you are testing to see if things are broken when you're product is "almost finished" then it may as well still be under development if you have not tested along the way.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Group work can get very messy between people's expectations, communicating habits, and egos. It is imperative to pay attention not only to the development that needs to take place but also who is working on what and which state they are in while working on these things. Paying attention to people's expectations is necessary as well as colliding expectation can set a bomb off within your group and kill morale.
