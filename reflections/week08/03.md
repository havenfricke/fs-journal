## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Software development testing is very much what it sounds like. Unit testing is a sub-form of development testing where you test small units of code which consist all things involved in what you are testing. For instance, if youâ€™re testing the HandBrake class, you should verify that when the pull() method is called, the lock() method of the two instances of Wheel class is called. Another test should verify that when you call the release() method, the two Wheel objects are unlock()ed, and so on.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

The benefits include functionality and ensuring things are actually working, optomization of code through testing for flaw and bugs, and realizing other potentiality of the code itself through the results of what has been tested.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

When code changes, existing code units need to be updated and tested as well. This can be time consuming and require lots of debugging. Collapsed code can also cause issues if there are notes intended to be read with the respective code that belongs to the notes.
