## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two people are using one computer to write code. On person is the driver and the other is the assistant driver or is in charge of the "coding autonomy". 

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Some of the benefits of pair programming are learning curves aligning, the principle that two heads are better than one at play, and fatigue avoidance due to the interchanging of the driver's seat.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Drawbacks can include disgust if the other has poor personal hygiene. If the driver is silent and not communicating then the aspect of "coding out loud" involved in pair programming halts.
