## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation is exactly what it sounds like. All of the documentation that we have read this far is code documentation i.e. bootstrap, vue, typesript, npm, node.js... the list goes on. Documenting code consist of comments and excellent naming convention that essentially describe thing just by their name but also include commentation to expound upon what is happening in the code.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

The benefits of code documentation include reference to code you and other developers can access in the future, new systems that are in developement that exceed the current standards of coding, and general collaberation endeavors in coding to be played out.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Code documentation is extremely important because without it we wouldn't have things like bootstrap, node, vue, typescript... this list goes on. All of these tools at some point were under development by devs like you and me and turn in to widely used coding tools.
