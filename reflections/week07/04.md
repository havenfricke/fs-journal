## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Designing a strong user experience. I tried my best make the UI a comfortable experience and the flow of information highly readable for th euser. 

2. What went well this week?

Justin and I communicated well and broke through all of our issues together. He is a really talented guy.

3. What would you do differently?

I would have made an array in our appstate that held our active projet and fetch a project by ID rather than iterating over the array of projects with a single one. Even though we were only accessing one project at a time it would have been helpful because in the end we need to fetch all projects while accessing a single project.
