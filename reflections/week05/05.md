# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

The course is going well and I am really excited for the gauntlet. I need to brush up on all of my skills after the past week. The tempo of the course let up a bit but I sense that it will pick back up here soon very quickly. So practcing my fundamentals at this point I beleive would be wise.
