## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string is a part of a URL that assigns values to parameters. It is the part of the URL that starts with "?" and is followed by some indicator of what data will be assigned to the parameter.

example: const res = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/test?a=1&b=2') <--- "?a=1&b=2" is the Query String.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

It is the part of the URL that starts with "?" and is followed by some indicator of what data will be assigned to the parameter. Parameters are constituent of a key and a value. Keys and values look like this --> "key=value" ---> They are separated by the "=" sign and indicate what data the URL is accessing. When looking at the query string "?a=1&b=2", we see that the "symbol" is separating two different query parameters, a=1 and b=2. 

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

A query parameter would come in useful when writing a server to access specific information. Lets say a function needs to get sspecific data on the server for our function to do it's job. We want a value the client side sent to the server in a specific location. We can access this specific location using a query parameter or query string.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

In today's assignment to put it simply, we are learning the entire process of full-stack developments' service. The Server. The server - much like the service in MVCS model - talks to the database to communicate data back and forth. It is a portion of the fractal essensce that lies within code.
