## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

One to one, one to many, and many to many. Each deal with how data is stored as well as how the data can share the same properties/values.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Linking relationships allow the data to exist in two places as two different set of data by linking them with a foreign key. This can come in very useful when dealing with one to many or many tomany relationships. However, embedding data as a property of an object is the preferred method in a one to one relationship.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

In many to many relationships we are faced with the challenge of organizing data in such a way that makes it easier to find data stored. For instance, one category of books may hold thousands of different book titles and one book usually only holds 1-3 different categories. This means that if we want a many to many relationship to work in our favor, we should embed the categories in our book objects' properties so that the data can be more easily accessible.
