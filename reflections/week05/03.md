## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is alowing a determined amount of time to do something you have planned to get done.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

1) Allowing enough time to plan - Timebox to plan your timeboxing. If We are only allowed a window of time to get something done, it is crucial that what the box is filled with is something that makes sense getting done at that particular moment in time you plan to do it.

2) Plan tasks in a chronological fashion - with planning in mind, we give ourselves a chance to oversee things we may need first in a project and things we may need last. Things in code can be interdependant or in other words, if we build the roof for a house before the foundation, there won't be anything to put a roof over. 

3) If you don't finish a project in time, take the remainder of the project and put another time-box around it. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I have benefitted from timeboxing during our weekend projects and labs. When I'm given a three hour window to write out some code before I go home and tend to other responsibilities or a weekend before my project is graded, I work hard to appease the timeframe. It's almost like awareness of passing time motivates people...

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment dealt largely with data relationships. They can be hard. Things get mixed up really fast. Deciding which are related and why they are related can be a logic rabbit hole. Conceptualizing the front end flow just by assigning data paths and relationships leads to many questions. Questions that have to be asnwered by the realtionships of the objects to each other.
