## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Some of the benefits of planning out code include some of the logic getting taken care of beforehand and creating a flow to your work. Instead of planning out the structure while coding, doing it beforehand can leave room for other types of problems you might run into. Having a structure beforehand can increase the logical flow of what you are writing. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

One way to find answers when you are stuck is to look at the history of the progress of the code and run through the logic gramatically. Another way check your work by logging to the console. The last key way to find answers when you are stuck is to is to google the answer. The internet is full of resources to learn and it would be silly to only work through the logic manually or from memory all the time.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

There is a healthy balance of planning, coding, taking breaks, reasearching, working through the logic on your own, and organizing information correctly. Too much of anything you put into your code beside quality can lead to making your code worse.
