## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log - check your own code by logging it to the console to see if the syntax/functions are correct

Using the console's text field - we can use this to invoke and identify our code to see if it is working properly in real-time.


2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab. It is useful when debugging because you can alter your code in the browser's environment and see changes in your code happen in real time. Each element can be viewed specifically in the elements tab which offers insight into each element's properties.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

By far the best way to debug your code is to debug as you go with console.log. Logging to your console often will catch errors as you code before you get too far into the coding rabbit hole. As Mick would say, code small miss small.
