## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is essentially what comes after the definition of a variable and describes how a variable is used therein. It also describes by which circumstances a variable is defined/utilized. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is when a variable or if-statement moves or utilizes data "post-defintion". If you were to log a variable with a block scope before defining it or, before telling an if-statement what to do, an undefined message would appear in the console regarding the defined variable/if-statement. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

We would use let when we want to write a conditional statement or define a mildy interchangeable variable, const when defining an array or object as well as conditional statements but want the data to remain once a function runs, and var to define simple variables that are easy to change and are also "global"
