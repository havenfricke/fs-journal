## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

function declaration: do not need to be defined by a statement and can still be invoked in that state because the definition is hoisted.

function expression: functions that define a variable. They cannot be used until they are defined and are not hoisted

arrow function expression: a shorter way to write function expressions

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

The two key differences are the location in which they are used and what they are used for. Parameters are the names whos arguments are defined and are used inside of a function. An argument are the values of said names and are used outside of a function.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

When a function uses another function as a parameter this is a higher order function. When a function returns a function it is also a higher order function.
