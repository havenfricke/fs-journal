## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

>The purpose of a wireframe is essentially to create a blueprint of the website you would like to begin coding out. Creating a wireframe goes over both the design and functionality of a website before it has even been written and this can be useful in guiding a developer through their coding process.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The different levels of detail start with usability conventions which determine things like navigation, icons, link behavior, and disability conventions. Spacing, layout, and information hierarchy are also levels of detail that would need to be considered in the wire-framing process.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

If the task is simple, probably not. Although, considering most tasks with coding are not simple, having conventions such as a wire-frame or blueprint in which guides you to an end goal can be extrmely useful. In the long-run, you may end up spending less time coding a website if a wire-frame is completed beforehand and followed throughout the coding process. This way, you are not thinking what to do next "on-the-fly".

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One key takeaway from today's lesson for me is that wireframing with a debugge rcan be just as useful as using a tool such as Figma. Building a wireframe inside of visual studio with debugging lines can act as a good blueprint before a lot of code is written. Especially when it comes to things like using the website on a mobile device. If conventions of sizing, containers, rows, and columns are tested before the bulk of the work starts, some of the formatting problems we may run into later on will be less likely to occur. My biggest issue right now is getting elements to size appropriately from different views on different devices.
