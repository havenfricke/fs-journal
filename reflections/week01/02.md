## Questions

>A pseudo-class is a selector in CSS that specifies a state in which the elements will be in. The most coomon one I can think of is :hover which changes the cursor when hovering over the specified element.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

>Specificity deals with the priority in which a selector in chosen and applied. The higher the value, the sooner a class will be slected and applied.
