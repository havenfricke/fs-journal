## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
 
 Inheritance allows us to create higher order rules and create reusability within our projects.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Even with a class that has an empty body, inheriting the base class gives access to any members of the base class and it's methods.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

On a class, acessibility will affect whether or not the class can be inherited. However, if the members of a public or protected class are private, once the class is inherited then it's methods can be as well.
