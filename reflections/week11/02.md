## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is an identifier or key that is independent and is either assigned or incremented where as a foreign key is also an identifier assigned vie other data table from other data properties. 

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias only exists for the duration of an sql query and are used to give a table or column a temporary name. They are used to make data more readable. (SELECT column/table_name AS alias_name)

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT 
d.*
p.*
FROM 
doctors d
JOIN
patients p ON d.patientId = p.id;

```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Many to many's need good naming conventions that are realistic in terms of what they are. This doesn't mean naming the 
object with the already existing objects it is in relation to. For instance, packages in a warehouse are not warehousepackages.
Apples in a basket are not basketapples. Bullets in a gun are not gunbullets. It hurts my brain.
