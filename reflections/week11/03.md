## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

SQL injections are attacks that give the attacker control over your application through the database. This is why we do not create string interpolated paths to our database directly but instead we use dapper to identify data we pass up to our repository layer.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

Inband SQLI - send payloads to the server and observe the response behavior and where to inject. Commonly observed through error thrown or , Inferential SQLI - attacks made "out-of-band" that are not actually sent through any channel of the application itself but to the server, OUTOFBAND SQLI - attacks that rely heavily on the response time of the domain name server and the HTTP request time (attacks are usually time-based with this one).

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

By using an IDS and both HTML and SQL sanitizers. Web application firewalls also protect from SQL injections.

Model views are simply additional classes that are reusable with preexisting data. These reusable classes utilize inheritance to take on data properties and always requred an ID that exists independant of your base schema classes.
