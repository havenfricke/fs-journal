## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I've enjoyed being able to struggle in the journey towards wanting to know something very useful and fun and the people I have been able to do it with.
