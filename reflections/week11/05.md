# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week I learned the relationship between many to many data objects as well view models rely heavily on front end features and what will be presented or come back to the front end. At the very least, a data relationship ID needs to be on the many to many object schema class in C# models. The base schema that the view model lives with is always inherited by the view model class so it is identifiable as an object in a many to many data relationship.
