## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

Component based architecture is essentially UI that is broken into smaller compnents that are self-sustaining. It is a way to have UI operate independantly from other UI found on the same webpage ie comment section, friendlist, and group pages all operating separately but on the same webpage.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

One of the main benefits of component based architecture is reusability. Features created on a webpage such as facebook can be recycled and reused in other intutive or creative ways. Much like the MVCS model where modules could be reused for functionality, the case is similar here as well.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

Readability can become degraded in some cases where you have a numerous amount of components at play in one application.
