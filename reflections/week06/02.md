## Questions

1. What are props?

Props are defined data passed to places where we are defining something. 
Example: 
class camera{
  constructor(data){
    this.name = data.name
    this.img = data.img
  }
}

export default {
  name: 'Camera',
  props: {
  	name: {
      type: String,
      required: true
  	},
  	img: {
      type: String,
      default: "https://imgurlhere.com/123456?img=7382136721"
  	}
  }
}

2. What are props used for?

Props are used for passing multiple data sets (objects) with similar properties to an element. Say you have an api of movies and you want to draw them to the page. You would use a prop to lay yhe data out and be able to access it for multiple uses likely in a v-for.

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can be used inside of your templates, models, or methods.
