## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

The purpose of Async and Await yet again, in ES2015 were ways to esstablish better coding rather than diving into 'callback hell'. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

Asynchronus functions first then, followed by await, then followed by function/operator.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

The primary benefits of async/await include the ability to allow getting and putting to be done in a way that is responsive to the network. It synchronizes the code functionality to the speed of which things are moving.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment was key in finding out that an async functions will always have an await follwed by an operation. They will also likely have a Try-Catch along with a console.error(error), and of course, the response will be logged. 

Also API's can be use to store information in a separate API. I imagine there could be multiple API's involved simultaneously when developing highly functional applications, which in turn calls for even more strict adhereance to naming conventions.
