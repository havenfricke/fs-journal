## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

First - Like many things in javascript, a promise is an object.

1) Pending: the initial state. The state of the object before it succeeds or fails.

2) Resolved: Promise kept and completed

3) Rejected: Unkept promise. It failed.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

We can handle operations with promises when using callbacks. We are able to attach a callback to a promise and chain promises with our callbacks. Difference is shown in the example below.

WITHOUT PROMISES:
_______________________________________
firstRequest(function(response) {
    secondRequest(response, function(nextResponse) {
        thirdRequest(nextResponse, function(finalResponse) {
            console.log('Final response: ' + finalResponse);
        }, failureCallback);
    }, failureCallback);
}, failureCallback);

WITH PROMISES
_______________________________________

firstRequest()
  .then(function(response) {
    return secondRequest(response);
}).then(function(nextResponse) {
    return thirdRequest(nextResponse);
}).then(function(finalResponse) {
    console.log('Final response: ' + finalResponse);
}).catch(failureCallback);

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The then() method is called after a promise is resolved. After, we decide what to do with the resolved promise.

For example:

myPromise.then((message) => {
    console.log(message);
});

API's have a specific amount of properties with specific names. Naming conventions in our model are important. We also can create a separate module to utilize axios and import and API function from it.
