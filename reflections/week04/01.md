> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Extremely long sets of code in terms of how many lines they take up at once. Code that isn't shallow is like reading a short novel. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchonrus in terms of code means giving an amount of time for something to complete its job. The end of asynchronus functionality is when the actual job is done. You're telling a function "Wait until this job is done, then move on". Asynchronus code uses callbacks - a function which is to be executed after another function is executed.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

3 Ways to fix callback hell is to:

1) keep your code shallow

            THIS:
_______________________________________________
  var form = document.querySelector('form')
form.onsubmit = function formSubmit (submitEvent) {
  var name = document.querySelector('input').value
  request({
    uri: "http://example.com/upload",
    body: name,
    method: "POST"
  }, function postResponse (err, response, body) {
    var statusMessage = document.querySelector('.status')
    if (err) return statusMessage.value = err
    statusMessage.value = body
  })
}

            Versus

            THIS
_______________________________________________

document.querySelector('form').onsubmit = formSubmit

function formSubmit (submitEvent) {
  var name = document.querySelector('input').value
  request({
    uri: "http://example.com/upload",
    body: name,
    method: "POST"
  }, postResponse)
}

function postResponse (err, response, body) {
  var statusMessage = document.querySelector('.status')
  if (err) return statusMessage.value = err
  statusMessage.value = body
}

2) Modularize. "write small modules that do one thing and assemble them into other modules to do bigger things".
Terminology - A module is a block of encapsulated code that communicates with an external application. 

3) Handle every single error. Syntax, runtime, and platform errors. Making code readable helps handle these errors individually. When dealing with callbacks you are by definition dealing with tasks that get dispatched, go off and do something in the background, and then complete successfully or abort due to failure. Any experienced developer will tell you that you can never know when these errors happen, so you have to plan on them always happening.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Todays assignment was all about APIs and how to access their raw data prescturctured within them as an object with/without properties. We can structure our javascript to better access API information and untilize it under the MVCS model.
