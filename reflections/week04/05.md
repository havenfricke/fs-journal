# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

This week I learned that having a top down understand from concept to technique is the best way to go bout learning code. Resources on the internet will always allow you to understand fundamentals but higher level concepts we are currently learning in codeworks need to be understood in concept as mentioned earlier, from top down.
