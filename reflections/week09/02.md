## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

A github action is when you create workflows via text files in your repositories that instruct github with actions to run every time the repo is used. Github uses YAML files to run actions and a YAML file is similar to a .cfg file in terms of it's function. YAML files are in basic terms configuration files. 

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

Github actions enable developers to conduct continuous integration and continuous delivery that include integrated tests for builds that are pushed an pulled from Github.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

Worflow, Webhooks, Scheduled, External. Workflow allows multiple builds to be merged, webhooks allow integration of things such as github apps or oauth apps. scheduled allows you to update-integrate-pulls-push at scheduled times, and external I am not sure.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today I was able to integrate a messaging systems but it does not live update. I am guessing this is where sockets come into play. I was also able to look into what goes toward creating an exe and tried to understand how compiled code is what makes up an exe. I also was able to get a Django environment built in VS and would like to try and implement Vue to it.
