## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

A base64 ecoded image is an image that has been encoded for better use of old caching systems with HTTPS/1

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

The drawbacks are cache hogging and crippling performance in loaded webpage images

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

The drawback issues involve speed. Now that we are working off HTTPS/2 and browsers perform much faster than before, we don't need to encode our images to base64 for performance.
