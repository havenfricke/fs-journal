# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance is one class inheriting the properties of another class as a child. I would assume virtuals on the backend deal with inheritance often.

```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The strategy pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives run-time instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Test driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed.

```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Definition of done or DoD represents the quality in which a product can be considered done in terms of what the backlogged items look and feel like.

```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. Two examples of this are 'like' buttons on facebook and the sharing feature that almost all social platforms have..

```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The planning ceremony is where the backlog is created. The planning ceremony happens before coding starts.

```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The daily ceremony is where tasks are either assigned to you or you self assign tasks. Good scrum practice has daily evaluation of assignments.
